# Custom server based on Express and GraphQL

## What I used

1. Express.JS
2. TypeScript
3. Next.JS
4. GraphQL

My target was practice with GraphQL, but after few days of practice I got that GraphQL don't fit my task in this project and require a lot of code to fit it, so REST API more fit in this situation, so I give up those project
